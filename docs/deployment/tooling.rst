Tooling
-------

Once we have the tendermint and application binaries and
have hand-crafted or automated all the config files,
we need to start up a bunch of machines and connect them
into a p2p network to power a blockchain.
How do we do this easily?

The best place to start is by looking at
`tendermints own tooling <https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/deploy-testnets.html>`__.

Please add notes to what parts of that works well, and any
weave-specific
